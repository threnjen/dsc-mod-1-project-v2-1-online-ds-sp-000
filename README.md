# Module 1 Final Project - Movie Studio Recommendations

For: Microsoft Inc.

By: Jenny Wadkins

## Introduction

>Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

## Questions

* Should Microsoft focus on launching a franchise, or focus on single film IPs?
* What audience should the company aim for (based on MPAA rating)?
* What genre(s) should the company aim for?
* What combination of genre, franchise and rating will result in the lowest risk?
* What, if any, genres/ratings/franchises should be avoided?
